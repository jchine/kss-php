# kss-php

This is a Php implementation of [Knyle Style Sheets](https://github.com/kneath/kss "KSS Knyle Style Sheets") (KSS), "a documentation syntax for CSS". Beyond that, it's intended to have syntax readable by humans and machines - hence, this module can be used to create a "living styleguide". The methodology and ideas behind Knyle Style Sheets are contained in the specification. 

There's an example project in the [demo directory](/demo "Example project") of this repo.
